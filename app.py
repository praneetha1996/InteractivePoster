        text="Work on suicide and suicidal behavior has risen in the last 15 years on many fronts, from the health, social and psychological dimensions to the broader world and influences at the community level where there is realization that mental health care and interventions are critical. Electronic health records ( EHRs) provide opportunities to mine patient data  for early detection and to improve patient care. The growing difficulties in recruiting trials, burdensome data collection and unpredictable common outcomes have been voiced. There have been doubts. To counteract these trends by using electronic health records is a subject of intense interest.  Long-term our goal is to develop predictive models able to use sentiment to detect risk factors associated with suicide such as homelessness.    Advances in natural language processing have made it possible to extract information from large scale unstructured data like nursing notes. Nursing notes extracted from MIMIC-III have not been widely used in prediction models for clinical outcomes, despite containing rich information.   Nurse notes have been found to be reflect the patient's perspective. Through our work we contribute to the longer-term goal by proposing a supervised machine learning approach using bag-of-words (BOW) and parts of speech. We compare word scoring methods and find that frequency performs the best. We built a deep learning model based on sentiment analysis that could classify patients notes as either POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.")
    my_poster.add_section(title="BACKGROUND",
        text="MIMIC III is an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising de-identified health data associated with ~60,000 intensive care unit admissions. We are focused on ICD9 codes of the Diseases of Despair patient group which include conditions like Depression, Mental Illness, Anxiety, Stress, Isolation, Unemployment, Alcohol or Drug Use, Previous Suicide Attempts. Mining clinical data to classify it by sentiment enables us to predict health risk factors by potentially identifying patients who may have negative sentiment. By identifying such patients early, clinicians can intervene. Deep Learning methods have been found to be effective with big and changing data and therefore appropriate for predicting sentiments in clinical notes.")

    #     text="A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. The model was built with a single hidden layer with 50 neurons and a rectified linear activation function. The output layer is a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for predicting 0 for negative and 1 for positive reviews. After  preprocessing, training data is prepared by calculating the sentiment polarity scores for notes of each patient and then fed into the model. The network will be trained using the efficient Adam implementation of gradient descent and the binary cross entropy loss function, suited to binary classification problems.")

    my_poster.add_section(title="CONCLUSIONS", text="The multilayer Perceptron bag-of- word model was successful and able to predict sentiment label for new clinical data with good accuracy. Frequency word comparison worked best for this clinical data. There are also some limitations and important technical considerations. MIMIC III data may not be generalizable as it comes from a small cohort.  Future work should consider using a larger dataset and continue to explore using sentiment analysis to predict social determinants of health.")
